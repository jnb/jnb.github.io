        <h1>Tic Tac Toe in TLA+</h1>
    </header>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Although I've written many informal specifications of software as part
of my employments,
I haven't ever written any <em>formal</em> specifications
(and for good reason: in most domains, the return-on-investment
likely isn't there).
I like to pretend to myself that given enough time, I probably <em>could</em> write a
formal specification,
but what's it like to <em>actually</em> do this?</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>Here I go through the exercise of writing a formal specification of Tic Tac Toe
in TLA+ / PlusCal,
and then use the associated TLC model checker to see whether an example game is
winnable.
This felt like just the right level of difficulty to get a feel for writing a
formal specification,
and had the nice payoff of actually being &quot;useful&quot; for something!</p>
<p>(Below I give code highlights; for the full details see
<a href="https://gist.github.com/jnb/78d8232c1e91d1542a1ac1c5119ed13a">here</a>.)</p>
<h2 id="the-game-state">The game state</h2>
<p>We need to start by defining our game state, which involves a couple of TLA+
definitions.</p>
<p>First we need to know what the current board state is.
For this, we're going to use a matrix, where the string &quot;atoms&quot; have the obvious
meanings:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>board = &lt;&lt;
</span><span>   &lt;&lt;&quot;o&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;x&quot;&gt;&gt;,
</span><span>   &lt;&lt;&quot;.&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;.&quot;&gt;&gt;,
</span><span>   &lt;&lt;&quot;.&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;.&quot;&gt;&gt; 
</span><span>&gt;&gt;;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Secondly, we need to know which player is next to go:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>player = &quot;x&quot;;
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="supporting-tla-definitions">Supporting TLA+ definitions</h2>
<p>With the game state defined, we next define a TLA+ formula for what is means
for a player <code>p</code> to win.
Here <code>\E</code> and <code>\A</code> are the existential and universal quantifiers.</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>winner(p) ==
</span><span>  (* Rows *)
</span><span>  \/ \E i \in 1..3: \A j \in 1..3: board[i][j] = p
</span><span>  (* Columns *)
</span><span>  \/ \E j \in 1..3: \A i \in 1..3: board[i][j] = p
</span><span>  (* Diagonals *)
</span><span>  \/ \A i \in 1..3: board[i][i] = p
</span><span>  \/ \A i \in 1..3: board[4-i][i] = p
</span></code></pre>
<p>We also need to define what it means for there to be an unfilled board space:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>unfilled == \E i \in 1..3: \E j \in 1..3: board[i][j] = &quot;.&quot;
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="the-game-algorithm">The game algorithm</h2>
<p>Finally, we define our game algorithm in PlusCal,
which will be automatically translated into TLA+.
Note the use of <code>with</code> for non-deterministic choice
(the model checker will explore all possible instantiations
for us).</p>
<pre style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;"><code><span>while unfilled /\ ~(winner(&quot;o&quot;) \/ winner(&quot;x&quot;)) do
</span><span>  with i \in 1..3, j \in 1..3 do
</span><span>    if board[i][j] = &quot;.&quot; then
</span><span>      board[i][j] := player;
</span><span>      if player = &quot;x&quot; then player := &quot;o&quot; else player := &quot;x&quot; end if;
</span><span>    end if;
</span><span>  end with;
</span><span>end while;
</span><span>assert ~winner(&quot;x&quot;);
</span></code></pre>
<h2 id="using-the-tlc-model-checker">Using the TLC model checker</h2>
<p>When we run this from the model checker,
we see that it's possible to reach a state where where our
&quot;x isn't the winner&quot; assertion fails:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.monkeynut.org/tic-tac-toe/tlc.png" alt="image description" /></p>
<p>Good luck <code>x</code>!</p>
<h2 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h2>
<p>(Caveats: I am not an expert, these are <em>my</em> takeaways,
this was just a toy example etc.)</p>
<p>I was initially wary of writing the definitions in &quot;math&quot;,
but it actually ended up feeling liberating <em>not</em> having to define
implementation details!
For example, I loved that I could write existential and
universal quantifiers,
know that the model checker would automatically handle the
&quot;implementation&quot; of them.</p>
<p>With that said, I liked that I could still write the game algorithm in PlusCal
(making use of TLA+ definitions);
this gave the game algorithm a familiar, imperative feel.
Which is exactly the point of PlusCal!
It was also useful from the point-of-view of learning TLA+ to hit Command+T and
see the corresponding TLA+ next-state relation.</p>
<p>I can imagine eventually writing everything in TLA+,
but for now I'll probably stick with a hybrid TLA+ / PlusCal
approach.</p>

The first four of Leslie Lamport's lectures
are a great introduction to writing your first TLA+ spec.
They're pretty short, and I found them laugh-out-loud funny.</li>
